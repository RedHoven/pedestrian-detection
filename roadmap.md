# Pedestrian - the data in the traffic startup 
-Comparing finetuning training 
-Adversarial attacks 
-People detecting race bias  
-Transfer learning 
-Layers visualization 
-Object detection vs segmentation - what is useful 
-how object detection can improve the segmentation of the model 

-Datasets:

-Papers/models:
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06870 MaskRCNN
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02640 Yolo - train from scratch based on the paper
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.10934v1 Yolov4
- - https://yolov8.com/ Yolov8
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07636v2 EVA ?? good?

Project steps:
- literature review -> find sota architecture + some clever modification
- train a phat model / fine-tunning
- RQs [choose 3 from below]
    - visuaizing layers
    - in the wild + weather + lighting + inside / outside built up area
    - racial bias
    - transfer learning
    - adversarial attacks
- web blog on GitHub

before Friday
sota
- EVA
- YOLOv8
-
what we cat train / architectures
- 
-
what modification we can apply
-
-
on Friday
- select favourite
- have a meeting with Ana to settle on the best option 


<!--  # Project Ideas
- classification
    - https://www.isic-archive.com/ https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/
    - http://ludo17.free.fr/mitos_2012/dataset.html detection of cancer
    - Edible vs. Toxic Mushroom Classifier
    - AI vs Human created content
 
most often 
    - Emotion recognition
    - Detect hidden objects (weapons, contraband, or anomalies) in X-ray images, similar to airport security scanners. are there datasets??

    - Music Genre Prediction from Album Covers
    - https://github.com/AlexOlsen/DeepWeeds weeds detection
    - Chess Move Predictor Chessboard datasets, Lichess API

- Other:
    - Transfer learning (model fine-tunned to segment football matches to segment basketball) (or build on general and fine-tune on more specific)
    - Generative approaches -->
